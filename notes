possible features for the future
    prettier UI (maybe fit the theme of raining)
    include images or sound
    let the game board be resizeable by dragging the corners
    better game over display
    options for how long to play the game for (and then just diving into basic typing game territory)

working on rn
1. better game over display with a high score(s) from localstorage

2. user input of "difficulty" and changing the speed/timeDelay accordingly
        types of form inputs (the little toggle down to select one of 3 things OR check off one of three levels?)
        i think we just change the initial speed accordingly for now
            maybe change the speed decreasing interval too after idk gotta test out how it feels
        STILL not sure how to have word frequency go up as the game progresses but

3. (maybe) using Random Word API to continuously generate "random words"
