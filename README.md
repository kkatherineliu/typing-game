#It's Raining Words!#

This is a super simple typing game where you just have to finish typing the words before they read the dotted red line. 
I coded this mainly to learn how to use basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript syntax from scratch so I definitely spent a lot of time reading through W3Schools to figure out what was possible

Here are some of the things I learned
- using HTML DOM to access various components of the HTML or CSS files within my JS code
- for each loops in JS
- anonymous functions in JS
- setting time delays using setInterval and setTimeout in JS
- using flexbox (even though I only had 2 side by side portions)
- resizing to suit different screen sizes
- using Google Fonts

Overall a fun beginner project and as a typing nerd I still find it quite fun to play.

following "issues"
- resizing does not affect word generation 
    - (so is it possible to detect screen resizing and then re-calculate the height and width?)
- just kinda plain/ugly 
- mobile mode gameboard display should be full width but its stuck at 75%

future implementations (notes to self)
- just thought of the "quirky name" so style it to fit a certain theme?
- just to demonstrate html/css knowledge
    - have reference links to cooler games (keybr, monkeytype, typeracer)
    - include image or sound
    - draggable components
- faster word generation on top of just speed increasing
- leaderboard display when game over 
    - (in general better game over display, "play again" type button?)
- user input of "difficulty" and changing the speed/timeDelay accordingly
- use of API to actually continuously generate "random words"
- options for how long to play the game for (and then just diving into MonkeyType category)
